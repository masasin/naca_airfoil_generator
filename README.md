# NACA Airfoil Generator
Uses Ipython and widgets to create an interactive airfoil generator

This program currently works for 4-digit NACA airfoils and should have all airfoil types eventually. It can also produce plots for use in various applications, as well as produce airfoils that have a similar shape but defined characteristics.

You can download it onto your own computer to work with interactivity. If you just want to see what it looks like, please look at [this page](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/masasin/naca_airfoil_generator/blob/master/Airfoil_generator.ipynb)
