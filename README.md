# NACA Airfoil Generator
Uses Ipython and widgets to create an interactive airfoil generator

This program currently works for 4-digit NACA airfoils and should have all airfoil types eventually. It can also produce plots for use in various applications, as well as produce airfoils that have a similar shape but defined characteristics.
